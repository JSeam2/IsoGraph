# IsoGraph
## Project Overview
The project is an experiment to see whether can we use some form of machine learning generalized to quantum computers to learn whether graphs are isomorphic or not 
Generate the adjacency matrices of Isomorphic Graphs and Non-isomorphic graphs.


The original intention for use was for an experiment which sought to simulate
the implementation of a quantum machine learning algorithm on a classical/"normal"
computer. The idea was to use some form of supervised learning technique to learn a 
sequence of quantum gates to find a solution to a problem. The problem that was to be
addressed was the Graph Isomorphism problem.

Project status: Still working on it. 

## Implementation
Using a genetic algorithm, found in /genetic. The program uses a sequence of gates to determine if a graph is isomorphic or not.
