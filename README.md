# IsoGraph
Generate the adjacency matrices of Isomorphic Graphs and Non-isomorphic graphs.
The adjacency matrices are stored as numpy arrays for further use.

The original intention for use was for an experiment which sought to simulate
the implementation of a quantum machine learning algorithm on a classical/"normal"
computer. The idea was to use some form of supervised learning technique to learn a 
sequence of quantum gates to find a solution to a problem. The problem that was to be
addressed was the Graph Isomorphism problem.

Project status: Still working on it.
